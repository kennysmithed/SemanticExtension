Took me a while to work out after the first pauses how to classify the splodges then in the absence of written notes - I chanted the relationships instead as if I can't write things down then I remember them by speaking.  I worked out it was a sort of logic problem and by a process of elimination established which shape/colour/photo related to which.

"24","p024","The second round of questions was difficult to be on the same wavelength I went more for a strategy of the stronger the colour the more sides the shape had.  So a plain old square for grey tended to work most successfully.  As for the third round that was simple enough the banana = yellow = star the buildings = sturdy = square the potion = danger = first aid (plus) sign the pig = fenced in = hexagon.  The final round was tricky again.  Only thing that really landed successfully in terms of strategy was assigning the hexagon to the crazy man again for the same reason as the pig in the previous round in that I felt he needed to be fenced in for his own protection.  As for the others it was hit and miss and my logic was constantly changing.","fixed_associations"

"51","p051","First thank you for this entertaining study. I really enjoyed it. The way I think it worked we suggested to each other the standard answer based on shapes and colors. Star is yellow etc. Then it turned into the partner helping me on which answers we were going to use. I thought the picture was a volcano but it could've been a glassed flask. If I saw my partner pick the same combo again after we were wrong I just agreed to it in order to be correct. A few objects had some easy correlation which made it easy to remember. The girl crying was the blue color because blue means upset. The star was yellow and the sun is a star. I thought the couple kissing should have been the diamond/pink because diamonds come from people in love upon engagement but my partner said star/yellow because of the sun. However the sun was in 2 photos but we eventually got on the same page. ","random_associations"

The last one was more difficult because it was unclear at the beginning if the colour/ shape should be associated withe mood of the picture So easy to remember the smiling girl is the sun but for me the couple should have been red for passion rather than the cross and the angry man should have been the cross. Once you sorted out that the association was your interpretation and not the system being used it was really just memory.","fixed_associations"
"68","p068","I figured out which labels to use by pattern recognition. This worked well for the pictures of people (couple in love angry man crying woman) and for the pictures of building pig volcano etc. It did not work well for the colour sections (both paint splats and solid colours).

Even though it appeared I had a rapport with the receiver if they got it 'wrong' I still stuck to my choice of female as we had previously got right in the hope that they were not actually changing their mind in the choice but could not remember the symbol as they were very similar. When being the receiver with the colours and the green edge picture did not actually match this threw me for a while as I could not ascertain how to match the colour to the picture but I feel I soon settled and hope you are happy with my results I found this very interesting thank you","fixed_associations"
"87","p087","Once we had established the shapes and colours link it wasn't too hard to assign colours to the cartoons.

"98","p098","as there seemed to be nothing to link the communication images with the viewed images I decided to make arbitrary associations between them for instance a star represented a volcano because it is an explosion and the cross represented the loving couple because they are together I then hoped that the frequency of the occurrence would help communicate the connection to the receiver.

For instance they kept selecting circle for the smiling girl presumably because she had a round face but I knew yellow was considered a happy color so I kept insisting on the pentagon until my partner changed their communication methods.

"166","p166","Wow such fun thank you. I found the different shapes colours hard but fun to try to work out the colour order. I didn't do well there. The animals to shapes. We worked out together somehow. Was amazing. Sometimes a bit off in the beginning. So the banana looked like a star kind of thing. We picked up on each other quickly how we both saw the shapes. gelled. and with the last lot - the cross for the angry man. the diamond for the couple.  star for the happy young girl. and the last shape for the sad. Thank you. Kind regards Brigitte.","fixed_associations"

"180","p181","I found this study fascinating it was so cool to see that just by clicking the same symbol each time the same colour or shape came up the other person quickly joined in associating these things. I personally chose to lead in that I would click the symbol I felt went together and upon the other person choosing incorrectly I chose not to allow their choice to become the accepted association and instead stick to my guns and allow the person to see my choices were the same for the recurring shapes and follow along accordingly. I was also fascinated to see how many few rounds it took for this to happen.","random_associations"
"181","p182","I originally was confused then realised i could relate the colours to the splats and pictures red or anger in the hexagon love and pink in the diamond happiness and yellow in the cross and sadness and grey in the circle.

"183","p184","The shapes were pretty straight forward just selecting the corresponding shape. Then I made a mental note of the colours of each shape. Then associated each colour of each shape to the picture e.g. red square for the volcano grey cross for the buildings peach circle for the pig and the yellow hexagon for the banana. The last round was a bit more difficult as I didn't know what the other person was associating for each emotion. So after getting a few wrong I was making mental notes of what shape they were associating with what emotion and using that as a reference to what shape to send to them e.g. cross for love circle for anger hexagon for sadness and square for happiness. I basically let them choose the shape for the emotion and used that as a key for the rest.","fixed_associations"

Then when the colours were mixed up I remembered which shapes had been which colours and matched the colour with the shape. (eg diamond was pink cross was red). Then when it was the pictures I matched it as the volcano being red as lava is red the cityscape being grey because of the colour of the buildings the pig being pink. Then when it was the pictures of emotions it was harder at first but then made sense because red is associated with anger yellow with happiness grey with sadness and pink with love.","fixed_associations"
