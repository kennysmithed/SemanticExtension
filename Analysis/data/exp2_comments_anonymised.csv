"208","p211","No I didn't take notes.  I saw shapes and colours.  When the study changed I first decided that the star shape should be yellow (stars are yellow-that should be understandable).  They picked that up rather quickly.  Then I ended up going with the five sided shape as being pink (which they also pick up really quickly).  I made the largest (six sided shape) grey since grey was the darkest colour there which left the diamond being red.  They...did not pick this combination up quickly and often mixed the two up and sometimes assigned yellow those shapes as well.  I realized early on that their selections were not always consistent-thus they were not applying a scheme to the combinations.  Several times I was tempted to switch the grey/red combination since they might prefer it that way or pick up the match...but I decided against it.  The key was to keep being consistent and eventually my partner would pick up that one is the other.  If I were to switch half way they would not know it and think the first and second half were equivalent in what I was trying to say and I would seem to contradict myself and confuse them.  But they eventually got it!  The last 10 or so trials we must have gotten them all perfect! :)  There were a couple tricky times where the colour for the designated shape wasn't available..in which case I went with the closest shade of colour...that was not so well picked up I think.

"662","p672","We both caught on quite quick to the strategy we were using. The opponent sent first so I remembered the first label they gave the first pic. Then I repeated the same thing when I saw it next eventually we caught on to the pattern using the previous labels we each provided to carry on the sequence ","random_associations","objects"
"663","p673","At first when the experiment changed i thought it was down to luck until i realised there was a pattern. So i tried to match up what i was seeing and kept saying it out loud.  I found it easier with the pictures of the people and the shapes that the colour blobs and the shapes","random_associations","emotions"

"667","p677","I have no idea what i could have taken notes about as i cant imagine any notes would really help. ","fixed_associations","coloured_shapes"
"668","p678","No notes - the second part of the experiment I tried to work out the pattern but ended up using a shape as close to the picture - probably wrong?","random_associations","emotions"

"671","p682","im not sure how we figured it out it seemed sub-conscious as well as some memory between the players for me I just thought of the first thing the shape reminded me of maybe taking cues from the previous round it was interesting!","fixed_associations","objects"
"672","p683",NA,"fixed_associations","coloured_shapes"
"673","p684","It was a very good experiment I really enjoyed it. It was easy to communicate which shape or colour we would select by assigning a colour to a shape. Once we both established that it made it much easier to select.","fixed_associations","coloured_shapes"
"674","p685","the splodges in the middle threw me off the most. it took a second or two to understand the emotions","fixed_associations","emotions"
"675","p686","It was just learning each time when the colour was added in yellow circle I got first then the rest followed till all were stuck in my mind. Didnt write anything down. Prob learnt a bit from the partner ","fixed_associations","coloured_shapes"
"676","p687","Fun experiment! ","random_associations","emotions"
"677","p688",NA,"random_associations","coloured_shapes"
"678","p689","That was frustrating as i didn't feel the partner was able to stick with the same colours for the same shapes and felt a bit like they were just pressing any button.","random_associations","coloured_shapes"

"680","p691",NA,"random_associations","coloured_shapes"
"681","p692","This was really interesting to see how you can communicate like this without speaking. To come to and understanding with each other what the picture relates to. Very fascinating! ","random_associations","objects"
"682","p693",NA,"random_associations","objects"
"683","p694","At first when just colours arrived it took me a while to remember which shapes were which colours. Then I made the links. With the pictures I tired to match colours with emotions in the picture. Pink- Love Yellow- Sun Purple- sad and red- angry.","fixed_associations","emotions"

"686","p697","I sort of figured out (around halfway through I think) that the colours of the blobs I was seeing were correlating to the colour/shape of the object that my partner was seeing (I hope)","fixed_associations","coloured_shapes"
"687","p698","during the second part with the paint slodges it took me a while to figure out to copy what the other person choose to go with which colour once it changed to people I knew to copy the other persons idea of what matched. very interesting study","fixed_associations","emotions"

"690","p701","It was confusing.","fixed_associations","coloured_shapes"
"691","p702","objects to shapes was easiest as you could apply some logic ie. a volcano explodes so choosing the star (like an explosion) symbol each time. Partner seemed to apply no logic whatsoever. ","random_associations","objects"

"693","p704","it took 3-4 goes on the same shape/pic to establish a 'code' that worked most times","fixed_associations","emotions"
"694","p705","We struggled a bit on the colours and shapes (some right some wrong)","random_associations","emotions"
"695","p706","The second round didnt make any sense we basically just had to guess. The triangle i had to use for the mountain there was no description to send. ","fixed_associations","objects"
"696","p707",NA,"fixed_associations","coloured_shapes"
"697","p708","Middle section was tricky. We quickly worked out circle was light pink but other shapes became confused. For the end section we tried to match the picture to the same kind of shape - building was square in shape so was square banana was curved so was circle pentagon was volcano and the remaining hexagon shape became pig as it was the last one.","fixed_associations","objects"
"698","p709","I tried to choose the shape which best suited the item. ","fixed_associations","objects"
"699","p710","I made a mistake when colour was introduced but I was thrown for a sec. ","fixed_associations","coloured_shapes"
"700","p711","I tried to keep the same shapes and colours in my head as were used in the previous sections and the other player seemed the most dominant at picking which pictures went with which colours and shapes so I tried to follow them.","fixed_associations","objects"
"701","p712",NA,"random_associations","objects"
"702","p713","There were a couple of rounds where I didn't seem to have the option I wanted to select and my choice was wrong.  Worked out what colours and shapes corresponded and used the colours to communicate the shapes later.","fixed_associations","coloured_shapes"
"703","p714",NA,"random_associations","objects"
"704","p715","For the last one I felt like the colour red best went with anger so that became the circle. The plus I kind of used the shape more than anything so a plus symbol is positive which went well with the lady smiling. Yellow I thought kind of worked for the picture with the sun/sunset in the background as the sun is thought of as yellow. And pink was just the one leftover really. ","fixed_associations","emotions"
"705","p717","In the photo segment I just went for the dominant colour or attribute colour of the sunlight or anger equals red.","random_associations","emotions"

"707","p719",NA,"fixed_associations","objects"
"708","p720","We figured out a way of communicating the cross with a colour and a rhombus. but we coundn't mangage to remember more than 2. i do't think me and my partner worked well together we both were associating different colours a lot because we both wanted to take charge","fixed_associations","coloured_shapes"
"709","p721",NA,"random_associations","coloured_shapes"
"710","p722","at first it was about communicating just the shape to my partner then the shape and colour and then finally the colour of the item eg pink pig related to the circle which was pink in the shape/colour round.  I found this quite logical to complete.","fixed_associations","objects"
"711","p723",NA,"random_associations","emotions"
"712","p724","i couldnt figure out when shapes an colours were not an option whgich one was going to be chosen it was just guessing","random_associations","coloured_shapes"
"713","p725","I always chose the shape to the left in the second part and it seemed for a high degree my partner recognised this.","random_associations","coloured_shapes"
"714","p726","At first it was very simple to help the receiver out and I was confused what use adding colours added to the difficulty but then when colour was the only thing to go off of it became apparent that each shape had to then be represented by a colour which took a few attempts for both parties to understand - pink became star grey became square hexagon became yellow and pentagon became red.","fixed_associations","coloured_shapes"
"715","p727",NA,"fixed_associations","coloured_shapes"
"716","p728",NA,"fixed_associations","objects"
"717","p729","Well for me the first part was easy just matching the shapes. Then when it changed to colour I was trying to match the colour with the colour of the shapes from the previous round and then with the images i tried to choose the shape closest to that image so my partner might match it with me","fixed_associations","objects"
"718","p730","Theres nothing I want you to know but I think the communication was figuring out what the other person saw and agreeing each shape was a certain object. very interesting ","random_associations","objects"
