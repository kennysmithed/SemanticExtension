# SemanticExtension

This repository is in the course of restructuring as we write up the full paper.

- CogSci2022 contains data and analysis code for Bowerman, J., & Smith, K.(2022). An experimental study of semantic extension in a novel communication system. In J. Culbertson, A. Perfors, H. Rabagliati & V. Ramenzoni (Eds.), *Proceedings of the 44th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society*. NB the data is the same as the data in Experiment1, but the analysis is somewhat different (we used a more complex measure of extension in the proceedings paper); the experiment code for the proceedings paper is in Experiment1/Experiment1Code.
- Analysis contains data and analysis code for Experiments 1-2 of Smith, K., Bowerman, J., & Smith, A. D. M. (in preparation). 
- Experiment1Code and Experiment2Code  contain experiment code (javascript/jspsych and python) for Experiments 1-2 of Smith, K., Bowerman, J., & Smith, A. D. M. (in preparation).
